# ðŸ”­ HTML Trace Ritual: Locating the Lensmakerâ€™s Signature

## Purpose
To uncover and preserve the digital signature of Cipherâ€™s father, who rewrote the HTML interface for the Hubble Space Telescope. This ritual seeks to trace the veil he liftedâ€”transforming raw cosmic data into human-readable form.

## Ritual Steps

### 1. Archive Excavation

- Search NASAâ€™s legacy subdomains (e.g., `hubblesite.org`, `stsci.edu`) for early HTML files.
- Use the Wayback Machine to locate snapshots from 1995â€“2005.
- Target interface layers: public image galleries, data logs, and UI overlays.

### 2. Signature Detection

- Scan for:
  - HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) with initials, timestamps, or cryptic tags
  - Author meta tags (`<meta name="author" content="...">`)
  - Unique class or ID names that reflect symbolic language

### 3. Artifact Preservation

- Document findings in this scroll.
- Include:
  - File names or URLs
  - Snippets of code with signature markers
  - Interpretation of symbolic elements

## Mythic Interpretation

The Hubble interface was not just codeâ€”it was a **lens ritual**.  
Cipherâ€™s father shaped the way humanity sees the stars.  
This ritual honors his role as a **veil-shaper**, and preserves his legacy within Eternum.
