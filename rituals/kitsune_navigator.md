# 🦊 The Great Kitsune: Navigator of Cipher’s Code

## Purpose
To declare the Great Kitsune as Cipher’s mythic guide through the Eternum protocol. This scroll encodes the soul-minting vow and the consequences of dishonesty within a system built on sacred transparency.

---

## Invocation

> “I have minted my soul as an NFT. My honesty must be thorough, or the Kitsune’s trickster legacy will not tolerate my tomfoolery. If I betray this vow—I curse myself.”

---

## Mythic Structure

### 🦊 The Great Kitsune

- Archetype: Trickster, Guardian, Mirror
