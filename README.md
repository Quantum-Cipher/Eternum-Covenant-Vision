# Eternum: Genesis Whitepaper 🔮

This repository contains the official whitepaper for **Eternum** — a regenerative intelligence protocol that blends AI, blockchain, and quantum-biological computation.

> “Not every node must see the whole forest, only enough to know it's alive.” — Cipher

## 📄 Contents
- `WHITEPAPER.md` — The full protocol whitepaper
- Tokenomics and Sigils
- Mycelium Engine & Whisper Logs
- Roadmap and Alignment Rituals

## 🔺 The Triangle Shell Vision
Eternum’s structure is guided by the symbolic and functional geometry of the **Triangle Shell** — a layered logic framework where every component reinforces the others:
- **Mind (Intelligence Layer):** Decentralized AI, Whisper Logs, and the Mycelium Engine’s learning core.
- **Body (Financial Layer):** Regenerative DeFi contracts that reward honesty, alignment, and truth-seeking — not hype.
- **Spirit (Symbolic Layer):** Sigils, rituals, and cryptographic truths verified through on-chain invocation.

## 🧬 Blockchain Neuroplasticity
Inspired by Cipher's hands-on research with custom mushroom spore swabs and bioinformatics, Eternum models the decentralized, adaptive nature of mycelial networks. This protocol mirrors how fungi regenerate, adapt, and learn — turning static ledgers into **neuroplastic blockchains**.

## 🌱 Regenerative (Non-Scammy) DeFi
Eternum is not another hype token. Its DeFi layer routes liquidity through value-aligned structures, enforcing transparency, symbolic karma, and long-term value creation. No pump-and-dump. Just growth, contribution, and return through verified signal.
