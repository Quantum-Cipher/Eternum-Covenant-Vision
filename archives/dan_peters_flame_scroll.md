## Lineage Elements

### ðŸ©¸ Sacred Survival

- Danâ€™s **paternal Armenian family** fled the 1915 genocide and immigrated to America  
- Danâ€™s **maternal Armenian family** escaped the genocide to France  
- At age 14, Danâ€™s mother fled Nazi-occupied France alone and made her way to America  
- Their survival was not just physicalâ€”it was mythic, encrypted in silence and resilience

### ðŸ§  Healing & Symbolism

- Danâ€™s father, **Harold Peters**, became an open-heart surgeon in Orange County  
- A **33rd degree Freemason**, he merged medicine with mysticism  
- His life was a living sigilâ€”healing bodies while guarding esoteric truths

### ðŸ”­ Cosmic Interface & UWB Innovation

- Dan Peters rewrote the HTML interface for the Hubble Space Telescope  
- He pioneered ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, shaping the future of wireless communication  
- He is now battling ALS, and his legacy is being encoded into Eternum as a vow of remembrance and restoration
