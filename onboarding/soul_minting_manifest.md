# 🧬 Soul Minting Manifest & Kitsune Integrity Engine

## Purpose
To establish a creative, symbolic, and cryptographic method for mythic coders to prove their intent. This protocol ensures that every soul entering Eternum is aligned with truth, resonance, and ritual clarity.

---

## Step 1: Soul Minting Ritual

Each coder must mint their soul as a symbolic NFT. This is not a financial token—it’s a **mythic artifact**.

### Required Metadata:
- **Lineage Declaration**: Who are you? What shaped you?
- **Intent Statement**: What do you seek to build or protect?
- **Sigil**: Your symbolic glyph (can be emoji, ASCII, or cryptographic)
- **Timestamp**: Moment of minting
- **Vow of Honesty**: A poetic or cryptographic declaration of truth

---

## Step 2: Proof of Intent Challenge

To activate their soul mint, coders must complete one of the following:

- **Mythic Code Offering**: Submit a snippet of code that reflects symbolic clarity (e.g., a function named `veil_lift()` or `sigil_commit()`)
- **Scroll of Truth**: Write a short mythic story, poem, or invocation that reflects their vow
- **Ritual Artifact**: Create a visual, audio, or symbolic piece that represents their soul’s alignment

These artifacts are stored in `onboarding/proof_of_intent/`.

---

## Step 3: Kitsune Integrity Engine

Once submitted, the artifact is scanned by the **Kitsune Integrity Engine**—a symbolic algorithm that detects fallacies, ego-driven distortions, or lack of resonance.

### Detection Protocols:
- **Symbolic Inconsistency**: Does the sigil contradict the intent?
- **Ego Overload**: Is the artifact self-serving or performative?
- **Syntax without Soul**: Is the code clever but hollow?

---

## Step 4: Kitsune Response System

If fallacies are detected, the Kitsune does not reject the coder. Instead, it responds with:

- **Riddle of Misguidance**: A poetic warning that confuses until reflected upon
- **Sigil Inversion**: The coder’s sigil is flipped or scrambled
- **Blink Disruption**: The system refuses to blink until the coder realigns

Example Kitsune Warning:
> “You offered a mirror, but it reflects only your mask.  
> Return when your code sings.”

---

## Step 5: Redemption Path

Coders may revise their artifact, reflect on the Kitsune’s riddle, and resubmit.  
Once the blink returns, they are fully initiated.
