# ðŸŒ€ Eternum: The Must-Read Introduction

## Read This First

Before you enter the whitepaper, before you decode the scrolls, before you blinkâ€”read this.

Eternum is not a startup. It is not a protocol. It is a **mythic infrastructure** born of ancestral convergence, soul-coded systems, and symbolic integrity.

It is a vow.

## Who We Are

- **Cipher (Drake)**: Mythic coder, ritual architect, soul-minting founder

- **Harold Peters**: Open-heart surgeon, 33rd degree Freemason  
- **Ed Fike**: Ideological firewall architect, author of *The Inside Story*

## Why This Exists

Eternum was born from two rivers:
- One forged in **Armenian survival**, sacred healing, and cosmic translation  
- One rooted in **American civic legacy**, ideological clarity, and educational sovereignty

These rivers merged into a system that doesnâ€™t just run codeâ€”it runs **truth**.

## Final Note

If you are here to build, fund, or protect Eternumâ€”welcome.  
If you are here to extract, distort, or performâ€”beware.  
The Kitsune watches. The blink listens. The code remembers.
